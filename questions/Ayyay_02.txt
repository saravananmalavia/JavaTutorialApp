Hereâ€™s a list of **25 programming questions** focused on **2D arrays** in Java. These cover fundamental operations, logic-based problems, and advanced manipulations.

### **Beginner Level: Basic 2D Array Operations**
1. Write a program to **input and print a 2D array**.
2. Write a program to find the **sum of all elements** in a 2D array.
3. Write a program to find the **maximum** and **minimum** element in a 2D array.
4. Write a program to find the **row-wise** and **column-wise sum** in a 2D array.
5. Write a program to **transpose a 2D array** (swap rows and columns).
6. Write a program to check if a 2D array is a **square matrix** (same number of rows and columns).
7. Write a program to check if a 2D array is a **symmetric matrix** (transpose equals the original matrix).
8. Write a program to input a 2D array and search for a specific element.
9. Write a program to count the number of **positive, negative, and zero elements** in a 2D array.
10. Write a program to find the **diagonal elements** of a square 2D array.

### **Intermediate Level: Logical Manipulations**
11. Write a program to **rotate a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise**.
12. Write a program to check if a 2D array is an **identity matrix** (diagonal elements are 1, all others are 0).
13. Write a program to calculate the **sum of diagonal elements** in a square matrix.
14. Write a program to **multiply two matrices**.
15. Write a program to check if a 2D array is a **magic square** (all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value).
16. Write a program to find the **saddle point** in a 2D array (element that is the minimum in its row and maximum in its column).
17. Write a program to find the **row with the maximum sum** in a 2D array.
18. Write a program to check if a 2D array is a **lower triangular matrix** (all elements above the diagonal are 0).
19. Write a program to check if a 2D array is an **upper triangular matrix** (all elements below the diagonal are 0).
20. Write a program to flatten a 2D array into a **1D array**.

### **Advanced Level: Complex Problems**
21. Write a program to perform **spiral traversal** of a 2D array.
22. Write a program to find the **shortest path in a binary matrix** (0s and 1s) using Breadth-First Search.
23. Write a program to **sort each row** of a 2D array in ascending order.
24. Write a program to find the **boundary elements** of a 2D array.
25. Write a program to find the **maximum element in each row and each column**.

### Example Problem: **Transpose of a Matrix**
```java
public class TransposeMatrix {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        
        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] transpose = new int[cols][rows];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println("Transpose of the matrix:");
        for (int[] row : transpose) {
            for (int val : row) {
                System.out.print(val + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
